                                                          BMI Calculator in Python
                                                          
A simple Python application to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height. This tool categorizes your BMI into different health ranges (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity) based on the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

                                                                        Features
                                                                        
Input: Accepts weight (in pounds) and height (in inches).
BMI Calculation: Computes the BMI using the formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)
Categories: Classifies the BMI into one of the following:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

                                                                    Prerequisites
                                                                    
To run this application, you need Python 3.x installed on your system.
Enter your weight (in pounds) and height (in inches) when prompted.

                                                           The program will output:
